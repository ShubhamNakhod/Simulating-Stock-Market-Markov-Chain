# Simulating Stock Market Using Markov Chains

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook simulates the stock market using **Markov Chains**, a mathematical framework that models stochastic processes with memoryless properties. The project provides insights into stock price transitions based on probabilistic state changes.

## Features
- **Markov Chain Modeling:** Defines discrete states representing market conditions.
- **Transition Probability Matrix:** Captures stock price movement probabilities.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Generates possible price paths based on Markov properties.
- **Visualization:** Graphical representation of stock price evolution over time.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

### Run the cells step by step to:
- **Define Markov states and transition probabilities.**
- **Simulate stock price movements.**
- **Visualize the market trajectory.**

## Applications
- **Financial Market Simulation:** Helps in understanding stock price behavior under probabilistic constraints.
- **Algorithmic Trading:** Can serve as a foundation for developing trading strategies.
- **Risk Analysis:** Evaluates potential market conditions based on transition probabilities.
