# Simulating Stock Market Using Markov Chains

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook simulates the stock market using **Markov Chains**, a mathematical framework that models stochastic processes with memoryless properties. The project provides insights into stock price transitions based on probabilistic state changes.

## Features
- 📈 **Markov Chain Modeling:** Defines discrete states representing market conditions.
- 🔄 **Transition Probability Matrix:** Captures stock price movement probabilities.
- 🎲 **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Generates possible price paths based on Markov properties.
- 📊 **Visualization:** Graphical representation of stock price evolution over time.

## Installation
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

### Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Simulating Stock Market Markov Chain.ipynb"
```

### Run the cells step by step to:
- **Define Markov states and transition probabilities.**
- **Simulate stock price movements.**
- **Visualize the market trajectory.**

## Applications
- 💹 **Financial Market Simulation:** Helps in understanding stock price behavior under probabilistic constraints.
- 🤖 **Algorithmic Trading:** Can serve as a foundation for developing trading strategies.
- ⚠️ **Risk Analysis:** Evaluates potential market conditions based on transition probabilities.

## How It Works

### Define Market States:
The model uses discrete market states such as **bull, bear, and stable** to categorize stock movements.

### Transition Probability Matrix:
A matrix is created to represent the probability of transitioning from one state to another based on historical data.

### Monte Carlo Simulations:
Multiple simulations are run to forecast potential stock price movements over a given period.

### Visualization of Market Evolution:
Stock price movements are plotted to provide a graphical representation of the simulated market behavior.
