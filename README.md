Simulating Stock Market Using Markov Chains
This project simulates stock market behavior using a Markov Chain, modeling price movement transitions as probabilistic state changes. It provides a simple stochastic model for understanding directional trends (Up, Down, Same) without relying on historical prices alone.

Overview
- Defines discrete market states: Up, Down, Same
- Builds a transition probability matrix to model the likelihood of state changes
- Runs a Markov Chain simulation over multiple time steps
- Visualizes market state evolution

Features
- Simple and interpretable state modeling
- Memoryless transition property via Markov Chain
- Visualization of market state sequences
- Easily extendable for multi-stock or multi-state analysis
