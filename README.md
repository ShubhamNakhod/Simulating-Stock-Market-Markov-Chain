# Simulating-Stock-Market-Markov-Chain

Overview

This Jupyter Notebook, "Simulating Stock Market Markov Chain.ipynb", provides a simulation of stock market movements using a Markov Chain model. It demonstrates how stock prices can be modeled as a stochastic process, transitioning between different states based on probabilistic rules.

Features

Implements a Markov Chain to simulate stock market price movements.

Defines transition probabilities for different market conditions.

Uses Python libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib for calculations and visualization.

Generates a simulated stock price trajectory based on given initial conditions.

Helps in understanding the probabilistic nature of stock market fluctuations.

Dependencies

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install numpy matplotlib pandas

Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook "Simulating Stock Market Markov Chain.ipynb"

Execute each cell step-by-step to:

Define the transition matrix.

Simulate the stock price path.

Visualize the results.

Modify the transition probabilities or number of iterations to test different scenarios.

How It Works

Markov Chain Definition:

A transition matrix is defined with probabilities of moving between different market states (e.g., Bullish, Bearish, Neutral).

Simulation Execution:

A random walk is generated using the Markov Chain process.

The state at each time step is determined probabilistically based on the transition matrix.

Visualization:

The simulated price movements are plotted to illustrate market dynamics over time.

Applications

Understanding stock market trends using probability theory.

Developing basic algorithmic trading strategies.

Teaching Markov Chain concepts through a real-world financial application.
